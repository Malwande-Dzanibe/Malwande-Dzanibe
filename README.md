### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Front End web developer with almost 2 years of coding experience in ReactJS, Standard JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5. A
Very good record of consistency in everything I do in my personal life, which is the reason why I am consistent in web development as well. I am a fast learner that is 
always searching for information and trying my best to learn and utilize the current trends in web development. I have a passion for building web apps that people 
would actually use in real life on a daily basis and making profit for the business as well.
