### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Malwande Dzanibe from Gauteng, South Africa. I am currently a frontend web developer / aspiring fullstack web developer. I am fluent in plain JavaScript and I have a good understanding of React.js

Currently I have over 1 year experience in plain JavaScript and a couple of months experience in React.js . In that period I have been able to learn a lot of frontend concepts and I am able to use them effectively in projects, especially the ES6 concepts that have also helped me to understand and use React.js effectively

Here is a link to my portfolio to see some of what I can do https://malwande-dzanibe.github.io/my-website
